During this conference, several of us decided to launch a new initiative to spark some additional creativity in our data science work. Introducing: **#RecreationThursday**!\n\nEvery two weeks, we'll be sharing an art piece for data viz folks to recreate/remix to get those creative juices flowing! Our first piece of inspiration is [Alfredo Hlito's Curves and Straight Series (1948)](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/205953) from the collection at MoMA in New York City. I actually dreamed up this idea for recreating modern art pieces with code during a recent visit there, so it's fitting to start with one of my favorite pieces from that trip.\n\nI've been trying (with little success) to learn some JavaScript this past year. While I *love* Daniel Schiffman and his [Coding Train YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWkPOfnGsw), I really needed a project to actually apply what I have been learning. I'm usually a pretty hardcore `R` nerd and `ggplot2` stan, but I'd like to use this new initiative to delve into p5js... here we go!\n\n![Alfredo Hlito, Curves and Straight Series, 1948](image.jpg){fig-alt=\"An oil painting of colorful geometric lines on a cream background. Starting at the top of the painting in the middle there is a dark yellow curve. Intersecting it in the center of the painting is a black line at a 45 degree angle and a dark blue curve. In the top right of the center area there are short horizontal black blue green and red lines. In the top left of the center area are horizontal green red blue and black lines. In the bottom left of the center there is a short horizontal red line. To us, the placement of these lines conveys a sense of balance and free movement. This in the spirit of Hlito's placement in art history, as one who rejected figurativism  and celebrated abstraction and geometry.\" fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nWe encourage you to include alt text with any recreations you share! Feel free to use the alt text from the image above to start off, and remix as you wish - maybe include details about your medium of choice, color differences or however inspiration strikes!\n\n## Hlito Remixed\n\nBelow is my recreation/remix of the original piece. Unsurprisingly, developing this gave me a much greater appreciation of the art work itself. For instance, getting that yellow curve just right involved making the circle it is based off of a little taller than it is wide. Mostly I just fiddled around until it looked right to me. After getting the overall structure of the piece down, I added some movement by playing around with the colors! This is what it looks like when you cycle through R, G, B values but maintain the original ratios between them from the original color value :D\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.3.0/lib/p5.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.js .mySketch .cell-code}\n// create the div that the figure will be rendered in\n$('<div id=\"sketch\" style=\"width:100%;\"></div>').insertBefore(\".mySketch\");\n\n// set up dynamic variables\nlet speeds = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2,\n              2, 2, 2, 2, 2,\n              2, 2, 2, 2, 2];\nlet color = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n             0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n             0, 0, 0, 0, 0];\n\n// color modifying function\nfunction lineColor(initial, index) {\n  if (color[index] + initial > 255 || color[index] + initial < 0) {\n    speeds[index] = speeds[index] * -1;\n  }\n  color[index] = color[index] + speeds[index];\n  return initial + color[index];\n}\n\n// set up background canvas\nsetup = function setup() {\n  // set canvas size and background color\n  let canvas = createCanvas(950, 950);\n  \n  // move the canvas inside our <div>\n  canvas.parent('sketch');\n}\n\n// draw shapes\ndraw = function draw() {\n  // set background color\n  background(227, 219, 205);\n\n  // set line weights\n  strokeWeight(5.5);\n  noFill();\n\n  // yellow curve\n  stroke(lineColor(195, 0), lineColor(182, 5), lineColor(71, 10));\n  arc(100, 250, 800, 900, -.75, 1);\n\n  // blue curve and lines\n  stroke(lineColor(3, 1), lineColor(70, 6), lineColor(162, 11));\n  arc(715, 570, 500, 500, 2.4, 3.8);\n  line(230, 420, 310, 420);\n  line(700, 300, 780, 300);\n\n  // green lines\n  stroke(lineColor(107, 2), lineColor(163, 7), lineColor(23, 12));\n  line(700, 320, 780, 320);\n  line(230, 350, 310, 350);\n\n  // red lines\n  stroke(lineColor(214, 3), lineColor(47, 8), lineColor(25, 13));\n  line(230, 400, 310, 400);\n  line(230, 700, 310, 700);\n  line(700, 370, 780, 370);\n\n  // black lines\n  stroke(lineColor(54, 4), lineColor(55, 9), lineColor(55, 14));\n  line(450, 350, 690, 590);\n  line(230, 440, 310, 440);\n  line(700, 280, 780, 280);\n}\n```\n\n\n<script>\n// create the div that the figure will be rendered in\n$('<div id=\"sketch\" style=\"width:100%;\"></div>').insertBefore(\".mySketch\");\n\n// set up dynamic variables\nlet speeds = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2,\n              2, 2, 2, 2, 2,\n              2, 2, 2, 2, 2];\nlet color = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n             0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n             0, 0, 0, 0, 0];\n\n// color modifying function\nfunction lineColor(initial, index) {\n  if (color[index] + initial > 255 || color[index] + initial < 0) {\n    speeds[index] = speeds[index] * -1;\n  }\n  color[index] = color[index] + speeds[index];\n  return initial + color[index];\n}\n\n// set up background canvas\nsetup = function setup() {\n  // set canvas size and background color\n  let canvas = createCanvas(950, 950);\n  \n  // move the canvas inside our <div>\n  canvas.parent('sketch');\n}\n\n// draw shapes\ndraw = function draw() {\n  // set background color\n  background(227, 219, 205);\n\n  // set line weights\n  strokeWeight(5.5);\n  noFill();\n\n  // yellow curve\n  stroke(lineColor(195, 0), lineColor(182, 5), lineColor(71, 10));\n  arc(100, 250, 800, 900, -.75, 1);\n\n  // blue curve and lines\n  stroke(lineColor(3, 1), lineColor(70, 6), lineColor(162, 11));\n  arc(715, 570, 500, 500, 2.4, 3.8);\n  line(230, 420, 310, 420);\n  line(700, 300, 780, 300);\n\n  // green lines\n  stroke(lineColor(107, 2), lineColor(163, 7), lineColor(23, 12));\n  line(700, 320, 780, 320);\n  line(230, 350, 310, 350);\n\n  // red lines\n  stroke(lineColor(214, 3), lineColor(47, 8), lineColor(25, 13));\n  line(230, 400, 310, 400);\n  line(230, 700, 310, 700);\n  line(700, 370, 780, 370);\n\n  // black lines\n  stroke(lineColor(54, 4), lineColor(55, 9), lineColor(55, 14));\n  line(450, 350, 690, 590);\n  line(230, 440, 310, 440);\n  line(700, 280, 780, 280);\n}\n</script>\n:::\n",
