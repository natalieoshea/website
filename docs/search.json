    "text": "Wow… life is a-changing far faster than I could ever imagine. I’m feeling a lot of emotions (to put it mildly) writing this last Recurse Reflections post. I certainly did not accomplish all the technical work that I had set out to do during my time at RC but many, arguably far more important, things were being worked through during this time. Isn’t it wild the way life can feel stagnant for years and then jump into hyper-speed in the blink of an eye?\nSomewhat frustratingly just as I was finding my groove at the retreat (nice balance of solo work and pairing and a good mix of JavaScript play and R deep-dives), I entered the final stages of several job interviews and ended up having to make some incredibly difficult life decisions within a short period of time. It’s been exhilarating, stressful, joyful, heartbreaking… you name it, I’m feeling it all. There’s a reason why they caution you to put off interviewing during your batch time if possible, but as an R programmer that really wants to continue working in R my opportunities are fewer and far between than your classic software engineer so I needed to strike while the iron was hot. All that being said, I have two big pieces of news to share coming out of this retreat:\n\nI accepted an offer to join the team at BetterUp as an analytics consultant! I am overjoyed about this opportunity to apply my data skills in an area that aligns so well with my core values of belonging and equity. Not to mention, it is a very R-centric company so I’ll be joining a whole team of R nerds which is an absolute dream!\nMy husband and I decided that it’s time to leave our beloved NYC and move closer to both of our families, so we’ll be moving to Chicago at the beginning of April. There’s a ton to be excited about with this new move, but I’m also really heartbroken to say goodbye to this time in our lives. Suffice it to say that I’ve been crying a lot lately… at the bodega, the laundromat, on the 7 train. Everything is beautiful and sad right now and I’m just… tender. Very tender. We’re renting for a year to see how it goes, and as my husband keeps reminding me, if we’ve been Stockholm-ed beyond repair we can always return. But don’t dare say my best friend’s name or I WILL have an emotional breakdown."

    "text": "New year, new me!\n(cue eye roll…)\nIn all seriousness though, this year is shaping up to be a pretty transformational one for me already. Like nearly every person on the planet, the past 2 (or 4… or 6…) years have left me incredibly burnt out. While I remain insatiably curious about the world around me, that curiosity has been sparking more anxiety than joy lately. As 2021 was winding down, I knew something needed to change. So I applied to the Recurse Center, was accepted, and here I am, beginning 2022 surrounded by a community of similarly curious programmers!\nIf you’re not familiar already, the Recurse Center is “a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers”. Retreats are run in “batches” that can be as short as one week (a “mini”) or as long as twelve weeks (a full batch). My batchmates come from all walks of life and are at all levels of coding experience, from decades-long careers at major software companies to career-changers just getting started. While most come from the software engineering or web development side of things, there are several other data scientists in the group. I am, however, the lone R programmer in my batch (or rather, the only one with that language as my main focus/love).\nGiven that one of my main goals for this experience is to shift from a scripting mindset to more of a development mindset, it has been wonderful to surround myself with folks that think deeply about what it takes to build simple, robust tools and programs. Though I do hope to inspire some others R/Shiny developers to consider doing a batch one day… I think our little community would be a very welcome addition to this one!"

I’m still very early in my JavaScript and p5.js learning journey, but here are some of the sketches I worked on.\nSimilarly I spent a lot of time hanging out with and pairing with the creative coders in the group, including ilithya who I have been admiring from a far on Twitter for a while now! (hi! hello! big fan! keep rocking!)\nRead a lot of the R Packages book and poked around the source code for several API R packages, including my badass friend, Sharla’s, dope opendatatoronto package (hi! hello! big fan! keep rocking!)\nWatched the first two lectures of Statistical Rethinking to (re-)learn Bayesian analysis. Richard McElreath is an incredible lecturer and got me excited about science again with his first lecture! (hi! hello! big fan! keep rocking!)\nWatched the Simple Made Easy lecture by Rich Hickey and joined the Software Complexity discussion group to listen in mostly… a lot of this went over my head but I enjoyed the breakdown of how to avoid “complecting” your programs. I also realized that I should probably pump the breaks on some of my R package coding ambitions and spend time really designing how I want my package to work first.\nJust generally enjoyed the good vibes, man."

My main ambition with this retreat is to grow and develop as an R/Shiny developer so I’m starting my batch by working on an R package (or rather one “big” one that I intend to publish to CRAN and one smaller, more playful one). I plan to tackle Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps later in my batch and hopefully develop an app with the {golem} framework. I also want to continue learning JavaScript and playing in p5, despite how much I currently suck at it. I think a week of #genuary was enough for me, but I will be returning to those prompts to refactor and maybe build on the sketches I started and also tackle some of the #RecreationThursday prompts I missed. To tie my JavaScript learnings to R, I also plan to read JavaScript for Data Science (co-written by the incredible Maya Gans!) as well as JavaScript for R.\nSee? The list is already getting unwieldy again (shakes head)."

I am absolutely obsessed with all the cool things folks are doing here, especially creative coding wise, and it can be really hard not to simply hop from project to project, making little progress on my own work, ohh-ing and aww-ing the whole way down.\nThat being said, I did make some progress on my own learning endeavors… but I do need to narrow my project focus (story of my life). I’ve been continuing to read the R Packages book and learn about APIs (including best practices for API packages). At this point, I feel quite confident in my understanding of the general package development workflow but honestly feeling the freeze of perfectionism when it comes to working on the R API wrapper I have in mind. This led me to ask the #rstats Twitter hive-mind about how they plan out packages before developing and received this amazingly helpful response!"

If you struggle with perfectionism like I do, this can be a great way to simply start coding. Rather than stressing about whether I’m designing the perfect system, this method keeps me working through the actual analytical challenges I’m facing, encouraging strong documentation and testing practices along the way, and then builds my package from my development RMarkdown file like actual magic. My only complaint about the system is that functions are exported individually rather than as a family of functions as suggested by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan in the R Packages book. I think the benefit of having your function definitions, examples, and tests all in one place might outweigh that drawback though.\nThe folks that brought us {fusen} also developed the {golem} package, a great framework for developing production-grade Shiny applications. I have been playing around with that tool as well and although {golem} and {fusen} are designed to be compatible, my initial exploration is suggesting that compatibility is not quite as straight forward as it could be from a workflow perspective. I’m hoping that I’ll figure this out more with time and maybe in a few weeks I will write up a tutorial with recommendations for how best to make use of both tools in tandem. Right now though, my biggest struggle is simply deciding what project (is feasible) to build out…"

To celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.’s revolutionary legacy, I organized some Recursers (including several awesome alumni!) to get together to check out abolitionist Mariame Kaba’s Slavery & Resistance in NYC walking tour. The digitized version was voted Glitch’s most inspiring app of 2021. I think one of the more shocking facts we learned on our self-guided tour was the fact that in 1835, a $100,000 reward was offered to anyone who delivered the dead bodies of the Tappan brothers, two abolitionists from Manhattan, to any slave state. For reference, that’s equivalent to more than 3 million dollars(!) today. Even if you’re not able to visit the sites in person (and many are no longer there), I’d highly recommend checking out the digitized version which has plenty of well-researched historical insights to learn from.\nAlthough we were covering a lot of heavy topics on the tour, we celebrated getting to spend some quality in-person time together by warming up with some delicious dumplings and noodles at Noodle Village in Chinatown (HIGHLY recommend stopping there if you’re ever in the area)."

    "text": "Odita 2008 Recreation\nBefore starting Recurse Center, I knew I wanted to use this time to play in JavaScript more. Specifically, I wanted to finally figure out how to recreate my favorite #RecreationThursday piece that both excited and intimidated me the moment I saw it: Phantom’s Shadow (2008) by Nigerian-American abstract painter, Odili Donald Odita.\n\n\n\nOdili Donald Odita, Phantom’s Shadow (2008)\n\n\nWhile this may look fairly straightforward to recreate with code (a grid of shapes, rotated and colored according to their position), it forced me to learn more about how to use classes and constructors in JavaScript to draw shapes programmatically (shout out to Ahmad Moussa for this amazing tutorial on this topic). Once I got the grid layout working correctly though, I learned that rotating shapes in p5.js is, well, a bit confusing. Turns out that by default, shapes will rotate around the origin of the sketch (the upper left hand corner) rather than from their center (Coding Train yet again came to the rescue with a great video explanation of this). After a whole lot of trial and error, I finally got it working by making sure I (1) drew the shape by referencing the points from the origin and (2) translating the shape to the proper x-y location before rotating. For my own little take on the piece, I simply added + frameCount to the rotate() call to make the shapes spin… I think the end result is quite pleasing if I do say so myself! Kind of reminds me of my colorguard days (if you don’t know what colorguard is, do yourself a favor and check out David Byrne’s Contemporary Color… that dude GETS IT).\nIf you want to play with the code yourself, feel free to toy with my code in the p5 web editor &lt;3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// create the div that the figure will be rendered in\n$('&lt;div id=\"sketch\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').insertBefore(\".mySketch\");\n\n// set canvas dimensions\nlet canvasWidth = 800;\nlet canvasHeight = 800;\nlet shapesPerSide = 8;\n\n// save list of colors\nvar colorList = [\n  [\"#ffac00\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\"],\n  [\"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\"],\n  [\"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#0052ae\", \"#ffac00\"],\n  [\"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#ffac00\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\"],\n  [\"#0052ae\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#ffac00\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\"],\n  [\"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#008a97\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\"],\n  [\"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\"],\n  [\"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\"]\n]\n\n// save list of colors\nvar angleList = [\n  [0, 90, 180, 270, 180, 270, 0, 90],\n  [270, 180, 90, 0, 90, 0, 270, 180],\n  [180, 270, 0, 90, 0, 90, 180, 270],\n  [90, 0, 270, 180, 270, 180, 90, 0],\n  [180, 270, 0, 90, 0, 90, 180, 270],\n  [90, 0, 270, 180, 270, 180, 90, 0],\n  [0, 90, 180, 270, 180, 270, 0, 90],\n  [270, 180, 90, 0, 90, 0, 270, 180],\n]\n\nclass Shape {\n  constructor(px, py, sw, row, column) {\n    this.positionX = px;\n    this.positionY = py;\n    this.shapeWidth= sw;\n    this.c = colorList[row][column];\n    this.angle = angleList[row][column];\n  }\n\n  display() {\n    // shape parameters\n    // points need to be relative to origin for rotate to work properly\n    let x1 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let y1 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let x2 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let y2 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let x3 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let y3 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let x4 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth * 0.15);\n    let y4 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth * 0.2);\n    \n    // shape color\n    stroke(this.c);\n    fill(this.c);\n    \n    // draw shape\n    push();\n    translate(this.positionX, this.positionY);\n    rotate(this.angle + frameCount);\n    quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);\n    pop();\n    \n  }\n}\n\nclass ShapeGrid {\n  constructor() {\n    this.shapes = [];\n    this.gridSize = shapesPerSide;\n    this.shapesize = (canvasWidth/this.gridSize) * 1.0;\n    this.spacing = this.shapesize * 1.0;\n    this.positionX = width / 2 - ((this.gridSize - 1) * this.spacing) / 2;\n    this.positionY = height / 2 - ((this.gridSize - 1) * this.spacing) / 2;\n\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.gridSize; i++) {\n      let row = [];\n      for (let j = 0; j &lt; this.gridSize; j++) {\n        row.push(\n          new Shape(\n            this.positionX + this.spacing * i,\n            this.positionY + this.spacing * j,\n            this.shapesize,\n            j,\n            i\n          )\n        );\n      }\n      this.shapes.push(row);\n    }\n  }\n\n  display() {\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.gridSize; i++) {\n      for (let j = 0; j &lt; this.gridSize; j++) {\n        this.shapes[i][j].display();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// set up background canvas\nfunction setup() {\n  let canvas = createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);\n  // move the canvas inside our &lt;div&gt;\n  canvas.parent('sketch');\n  angleMode(DEGREES);\n  grid = new ShapeGrid();\n}\n\n// draw shapes\nfunction draw() {\n  background(149, 151, 138);\n  grid.display();\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: Working in the high-touch world of consulting, our team needed to develop a reporting system that was flexible enough to be tailored to the specific needs of any given partner while still reducing the highly manual nature of populating client-ready slide decks with various metrics and data visualizations. Utilizing the extensive resources developed by the R user community, I was able to create a flexible, scalable reporting system that allows users to populate templated Google slide decks with metrics and professional-grade visualizations using data pulled directly from our database at the time of query. This streamlined approach enables our consultants to spend less time copy-pasting data from one channel to another and instead focus on what they do best: surfacing business-relevant insights and recommendations for our partners.\nBy sharing my approach to customizable self-serve reporting in Shiny, I hope attendees will walk away with new ideas about how to combine parameterized reporting and dashboard development to get the best of both worlds. Additionally, I hope to end by sharing how this project was pivotal in making the business case for procuring Posit products for my broader organization.\nVideo"
