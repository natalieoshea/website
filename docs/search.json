    "text": "Around this time last year, as I was wrapping up my time as a community outreach data analyst for the NYC Census 2020 initiative and preparing to join the NYC Test & Trace Corps, I had the opportunity to attend Kyle Walker’s Penn MUSA Masterclass on mapping and analyzing early voting accessibility. I had already been working with the tidycensus package extensively but was excited to learn about how I could integrate more advanced geospatial mapping techniques with census data to help target specific populations for a more data-informed and equitable outreach strategy. I could see the relevance of this approach for COVID-19 testing accessibility, so I modified the analysis to help address questions around how best to deploy mobile testing resources so that all New Yorkers could have ample access to testing.\nIn the example below, I walk through how to perform an analysis of COVID-19 testing accessibility and identify potential gaps filtered by census demographic data. Feel free to try this approach using testing location data from your own city! If you check out the tutorial I linked above, there is information on how you can use mapboxapi for geocoding. So if you only have access to a list of addresses but no latitude/longitude coordinates, you too can perform this analysis with a little extra work!"

    "text": "Getting Started\nBefore you can use tidycensus and mapboxapi, you’ll need to set up your access tokens and API keys in your R environment file. You’ll need to visit the following sites to obtain these key pieces of information (more detailed setup information is available in the main tutorial):\n\nMapbox Access Token\nCensus API Key\n\nOnce you have this information, you can use the code block below to save these variables to your system.\n\n# install packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\",\"tidycensus\",\"sf\",\"leaflet\",\"usethis\",\n                   \"mapboxapi\",\"fasterize\",\"raster\",\"tigris\", \"geojsonio\"))\n\n# mapbox access token (only need to install once)\n# sign up and get access token here: https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/\nmy_token &lt;- 'MY_TOKEN_HERE'\nmapboxapi::mb_access_token(my_token, install = TRUE)\n\n# census api key (only need to install once)\n# sign up and get api key here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html\nmy_key &lt;- 'MY_KEY_HERE'\ntidycensus::census_api_key(my_key, install = TRUE)\n\n# restart R and check installations\n.rs.restartR()\nSys.getenv(\"CENSUS_API_KEY\")\nSys.getenv(\"MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN\")\n\n# if you're having issues, you can manually edit your .Renviron file\nusethis::edit_r_environ()\n\nAlright! Now that we’re all set up with our R environment, we can start the analysis. First things first, we need to load our data processing libraries and CSV files. Below, I load two CSV files, one with the testing site locations and a crosswalk file that identifies census tracts that have been labeled as parks, cemeteries, and other public spaces that have few inhabitants. This isn’t strictly necessary for this analysis, but is helpful for filtering out large parks that are often identified as testing accessibility gaps.\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(mapboxapi)\nlibrary(fasterize)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tigris)\n\n# load data\ncrosswalk &lt;- read_csv(\"data/crosswalk_tracts2010.csv\") %&gt;%\n  # save only tracts in park-cemetery-etc (used to filter target areas)\n  filter(str_detect(neighborhood, \"park-\")) \n\ntesting_sites &lt;- read_csv(\"data/testing_sites.csv\")\n\nNext let’s take a quick look at our testing locations, and make sure they’re where we expect them to be (i.e., within New York City).\n\n# save base map\nmapbox_map &lt;- leaflet() %&gt;%\n  addMapboxTiles(style_id = \"light-v10\",\n                 username = \"mapbox\")\n\n# testing location map\ntesting_map &lt;- mapbox_map %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(data = testing_sites,\n                   radius = 3,\n                   stroke = FALSE,\n                   fillOpacity = 1)\ntesting_map"

    "text": "Calculate Isochrones\nNow it’s time to calculate our walking distance isochrones. But first, what the heck is an isochrone anyways? Isochrones are simply maps that show the area accessible from a given point within a certain time range. Using mapboxapi, you can calculate walking, cycling, or driving distances. We’re going to choose walking distances because boo cars! This is New York City, baby! I’m walking here!\n\n# save crs\ncrs_4326 &lt;- sp::CRS(SRS_string = \"EPSG:4326\")\ncrs_3857 &lt;- sp::CRS(SRS_string = \"EPSG:3857\")\n\n# test isochrone map\ntest_iso &lt;- testing_sites %&gt;%\n  # pull first testing site\n  slice(1) %&gt;%\n  # use lat/long coordinates for mapping\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\",\"latitude\"), crs = crs_4326) %&gt;%\n  # calculate walking distance isochrones\n  mb_isochrone(profile = \"walking\", time = c(10,20,30))\n\n# color palette of 3 viridis colors\ncolors &lt;- viridisLite::viridis(3)\n\n# map 10, 20, and 30 walking distance isochrones\ntest_iso_map &lt;- mapbox_map %&gt;%\n  addPolygons(data = test_iso,\n              color = rev(colors),\n              fillColor = rev(colors),\n              fillOpacity = 0.5,\n              weight = 0.2) %&gt;%\n  addLegend(labels = c(10,20,30),\n            colors = colors,\n            title = \"Walk time to testing&lt;br/&gt;location (minutes)\")\ntest_iso_map\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we can calculate walking distances from a single testing location, but to better understand just how many testing locations are clustered in a particular area we need to create a heatmap of the number of sites within a 20-min walk across the city. To do that, we’ll calculate isochrones for each of our nearly 500 testing sites and then merge them into a raster map that illustrates the number of testing sites within a 20-min walk from any given location in the city. If you happen to have an estimate of how many tests are processed at each location you could instead point to that information in the mutate(test_id = 1) line to get a map of citywide testing capacity, which is a related but somewhat different question from testing accessibility.\n\n# calculate 20 minute walking isochrones for all testing sides\nlocation_isochrone_all_20 &lt;- testing_sites %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\",\"latitude\"), crs = crs_4326) %&gt;%\n  mb_isochrone(profile = \"walking\", time = c(20)) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs_3857) \n\n# add column to indicate testing site count (1 testing site per mapped location)\n# could be modified with an estimate of testing capacity\npolygons_proj &lt;- location_isochrone_all_20 %&gt;%\n  mutate(test_id = 1)\n\n# create a raster layer object\ntemplate &lt;- raster(polygons_proj, resolution = 25, crs = crs_3857)\n\n# generate raster layer using the sum of all testing locations\nraster_surface &lt;- fasterize(polygons_proj, template, field = \"test_id\", fun = \"sum\")\n\n# define the range of raster values (# of testing sites within a 20 min walk of a given area)\nraster_values &lt;- tibble(values = values(raster_surface)) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(values)) %&gt;% \n  distinct(values) %&gt;% \n  pull(values)\n\n# create viridis color palette with range raster values\ncustom_pal &lt;- colorNumeric(\"viridis\",\n                           raster_values,\n                           na.color = \"transparent\")\n\n# create a heatmap of testing sites throughout the city\nlocation_heatmap_all_20 &lt;- mapbox_map %&gt;%\n  addRasterImage(raster_surface, colors = custom_pal,\n                 opacity = .75, group = \"Raster\") %&gt;%\n  addLegend(pal = custom_pal,\n            values = raster_values,\n            title = \"Number of testing sites&lt;br&gt;within 20-minute walk\") \nlocation_heatmap_all_20"

    "text": "Identify Target Areas\nFinally, now that we have a better idea of where testing locations currently are we can start to explore where new testing resources should be and use census data to target particular demographics for a more equitable resource deployment strategy.\nSimply looking at the previous maps, we can see that we have more limited testing accessibility in Staten Island. However, folks on Staten Island tend to have greater access to personal vehicles so let’s use data from the census to filter out areas with high car ownership. Additionally, we’ll want to pull the hydrogeography data for NYC using the tigris package so we can trim out water areas from our resulting target areas map.\n\n# download percent occupied housing units with no vehicles available from ACS\nno_cars &lt;- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = \"DP04_0058P\",\n  state = \"NY\",\n  county = c(\"Bronx\", \"Kings\", \"New York\", \"Queens\", \"Richmond\"),\n  geometry = TRUE,\n  cb = FALSE\n) %&gt;%\n  # if park census tract, set to NA\n  mutate(estimate = ifelse(GEOID %in% crosswalk$GEOID10, NA, estimate))\n\n# save area hydrography shapefile\nwater &lt;- area_water(\"NY\", c(\"Bronx\", \"Kings\", \"New York\", \"Queens\", \"Richmond\"), class = \"sf\") %&gt;%\n  # combine into one geometry\n  st_union()\n\nBelow, I use lots of functions from the wonderful sf package to prepare our shapefiles for analysis, filter out census tracts with high car ownership, and cut out areas within a 20-min walking radius of a testing site. The resulting map identifies key target areas where folks lack nearby testing resources and don’t have access to a personal vehicle to easily get to a testing site without needing to use public transportation. Overall, we can see that NYC has quite extensive COVID-19 testing accessibility with only a few areas identified as gaps. Pretty cool, huh?\n\n# erase overlapping areas (trims water areas of census tracts)\nno_cars_erase &lt;- st_difference(no_cars, water)\n\n# set CRS for walking isochrones\nisochrones &lt;- location_isochrone_all_20 %&gt;%\n  # transform CRS (needed for st_difference step in target areas calculation)\n  st_transform(crs_3857) %&gt;%\n  # combine into one geometry\n  st_union() %&gt;%\n  # force valid geometry\n  st_make_valid()\n\n# save target areas for resource deployment\ntarget_areas &lt;- no_cars_erase %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs_3857) %&gt;%\n  # only save tracts with &gt;15% of households lacking personal vehicle\n  filter(estimate &gt;= 15) %&gt;%\n  # force valid geometry\n  st_make_valid() %&gt;%\n  # cut out areas from census tracts that overlap with 20-min walking isochrone\n  st_difference(isochrones) %&gt;%\n  # tranform back into mapping CRS\n  st_transform(4326) %&gt;%\n  # extract target polygons\n  st_collection_extract(type = \"POLYGON\")\n\n# map target areas\ntargets &lt;- mapbox_map %&gt;%\n  addPolygons(data = target_areas,\n              stroke = FALSE,\n              color = \"#713e7c\",\n              fillOpacity = 1)\ntargets\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all! Again, I highly recommend checking out the original tutorial to learn more about integrating mapboxapi and tidycensus. If you’re looking for an even broader introduction to analyzing census data with R, you might want to take a look at the book, Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R."

I am absolutely obsessed with all the cool things folks are doing here, especially creative coding wise, and it can be really hard not to simply hop from project to project, making little progress on my own work, ohh-ing and aww-ing the whole way down.\nThat being said, I did make some progress on my own learning endeavors… but I do need to narrow my project focus (story of my life). I’ve been continuing to read the R Packages book and learn about APIs (including best practices for API packages). At this point, I feel quite confident in my understanding of the general package development workflow but honestly feeling the freeze of perfectionism when it comes to working on the R API wrapper I have in mind. This led me to ask the #rstats Twitter hive-mind about how they plan out packages before developing and received this amazingly helpful response!"

If you struggle with perfectionism like I do, this can be a great way to simply start coding. Rather than stressing about whether I’m designing the perfect system, this method keeps me working through the actual analytical challenges I’m facing, encouraging strong documentation and testing practices along the way, and then builds my package from my development RMarkdown file like actual magic. My only complaint about the system is that functions are exported individually rather than as a family of functions as suggested by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan in the R Packages book. I think the benefit of having your function definitions, examples, and tests all in one place might outweigh that drawback though.\nThe folks that brought us {fusen} also developed the {golem} package, a great framework for developing production-grade Shiny applications. I have been playing around with that tool as well and although {golem} and {fusen} are designed to be compatible, my initial exploration is suggesting that compatibility is not quite as straight forward as it could be from a workflow perspective. I’m hoping that I’ll figure this out more with time and maybe in a few weeks I will write up a tutorial with recommendations for how best to make use of both tools in tandem. Right now though, my biggest struggle is simply deciding what project (is feasible) to build out…"

To celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.’s revolutionary legacy, I organized some Recursers (including several awesome alumni!) to get together to check out abolitionist Mariame Kaba’s Slavery & Resistance in NYC walking tour. The digitized version was voted Glitch’s most inspiring app of 2021. I think one of the more shocking facts we learned on our self-guided tour was the fact that in 1835, a $100,000 reward was offered to anyone who delivered the dead bodies of the Tappan brothers, two abolitionists from Manhattan, to any slave state. For reference, that’s equivalent to more than 3 million dollars(!) today. Even if you’re not able to visit the sites in person (and many are no longer there), I’d highly recommend checking out the digitized version which has plenty of well-researched historical insights to learn from.\nAlthough we were covering a lot of heavy topics on the tour, we celebrated getting to spend some quality in-person time together by warming up with some delicious dumplings and noodles at Noodle Village in Chinatown (HIGHLY recommend stopping there if you’re ever in the area)."

    "text": "Wow… life is a-changing far faster than I could ever imagine. I’m feeling a lot of emotions (to put it mildly) writing this last Recurse Reflections post. I certainly did not accomplish all the technical work that I had set out to do during my time at RC but many, arguably far more important, things were being worked through during this time. Isn’t it wild the way life can feel stagnant for years and then jump into hyper-speed in the blink of an eye?\nSomewhat frustratingly just as I was finding my groove at the retreat (nice balance of solo work and pairing and a good mix of JavaScript play and R deep-dives), I entered the final stages of several job interviews and ended up having to make some incredibly difficult life decisions within a short period of time. It’s been exhilarating, stressful, joyful, heartbreaking… you name it, I’m feeling it all. There’s a reason why they caution you to put off interviewing during your batch time if possible, but as an R programmer that really wants to continue working in R my opportunities are fewer and far between than your classic software engineer so I needed to strike while the iron was hot. All that being said, I have two big pieces of news to share coming out of this retreat:\n\nI accepted an offer to join the team at BetterUp as an analytics consultant! I am overjoyed about this opportunity to apply my data skills in an area that aligns so well with my core values of belonging and equity. Not to mention, it is a very R-centric company so I’ll be joining a whole team of R nerds which is an absolute dream!\nMy husband and I decided that it’s time to leave our beloved NYC and move closer to both of our families, so we’ll be moving to Chicago at the beginning of April. There’s a ton to be excited about with this new move, but I’m also really heartbroken to say goodbye to this time in our lives. Suffice it to say that I’ve been crying a lot lately… at the bodega, the laundromat, on the 7 train. Everything is beautiful and sad right now and I’m just… tender. Very tender. We’re renting for a year to see how it goes, and as my husband keeps reminding me, if we’ve been Stockholm-ed beyond repair we can always return. But don’t dare say my best friend’s name or I WILL have an emotional breakdown."

I’m sure I’ll have more to share in the coming weeks, but I have been overwhelmed by life things lately (thankfully all good things, but overwhelming nonetheless).\nDuring my coding time, I’ve been continuing to plug away at some personal projects that still aren’t quite ready to share but I’ll touch base on one thing that I’ve been working on during the past couple of weeks: catching up on #RecreationThursday prompts. In the next couple of weeks, I’ll have more to share but for now just enjoy some pretty colors :D"

    "text": "Odita 2008 Recreation\nBefore starting Recurse Center, I knew I wanted to use this time to play in JavaScript more. Specifically, I wanted to finally figure out how to recreate my favorite #RecreationThursday piece that both excited and intimidated me the moment I saw it: Phantom’s Shadow (2008) by Nigerian-American abstract painter, Odili Donald Odita.\n\n\n\nOdili Donald Odita, Phantom’s Shadow (2008)\n\n\nWhile this may look fairly straightforward to recreate with code (a grid of shapes, rotated and colored according to their position), it forced me to learn more about how to use classes and constructors in JavaScript to draw shapes programmatically (shout out to Ahmad Moussa for this amazing tutorial on this topic). Once I got the grid layout working correctly though, I learned that rotating shapes in p5.js is, well, a bit confusing. Turns out that by default, shapes will rotate around the origin of the sketch (the upper left hand corner) rather than from their center (Coding Train yet again came to the rescue with a great video explanation of this). After a whole lot of trial and error, I finally got it working by making sure I (1) drew the shape by referencing the points from the origin and (2) translating the shape to the proper x-y location before rotating. For my own little take on the piece, I simply added + frameCount to the rotate() call to make the shapes spin… I think the end result is quite pleasing if I do say so myself! Kind of reminds me of my colorguard days (if you don’t know what colorguard is, do yourself a favor and check out David Byrne’s Contemporary Color… that dude GETS IT).\nIf you want to play with the code yourself, feel free to toy with my code in the p5 web editor &lt;3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// create the div that the figure will be rendered in\n$('&lt;div id=\"sketch\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').insertBefore(\".mySketch\");\n\n// set canvas dimensions\nlet canvasWidth = 800;\nlet canvasHeight = 800;\nlet shapesPerSide = 8;\n\n// save list of colors\nvar colorList = [\n  [\"#ffac00\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\"],\n  [\"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\"],\n  [\"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#0052ae\", \"#ffac00\"],\n  [\"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#ffac00\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\"],\n  [\"#0052ae\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#ffac00\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\"],\n  [\"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#008a97\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\"],\n  [\"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\"],\n  [\"#008a97\", \"#f8856c\", \"#ffac00\", \"#0052ae\", \"#f8856c\", \"#0052ae\", \"#008a97\", \"#ffac00\"]\n]\n\n// save list of colors\nvar angleList = [\n  [0, 90, 180, 270, 180, 270, 0, 90],\n  [270, 180, 90, 0, 90, 0, 270, 180],\n  [180, 270, 0, 90, 0, 90, 180, 270],\n  [90, 0, 270, 180, 270, 180, 90, 0],\n  [180, 270, 0, 90, 0, 90, 180, 270],\n  [90, 0, 270, 180, 270, 180, 90, 0],\n  [0, 90, 180, 270, 180, 270, 0, 90],\n  [270, 180, 90, 0, 90, 0, 270, 180],\n]\n\nclass Shape {\n  constructor(px, py, sw, row, column) {\n    this.positionX = px;\n    this.positionY = py;\n    this.shapeWidth= sw;\n    this.c = colorList[row][column];\n    this.angle = angleList[row][column];\n  }\n\n  display() {\n    // shape parameters\n    // points need to be relative to origin for rotate to work properly\n    let x1 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let y1 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let x2 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let y2 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let x3 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let y3 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth / 2);\n    let x4 = 0 + (this.shapeWidth * 0.15);\n    let y4 = 0 - (this.shapeWidth * 0.2);\n    \n    // shape color\n    stroke(this.c);\n    fill(this.c);\n    \n    // draw shape\n    push();\n    translate(this.positionX, this.positionY);\n    rotate(this.angle + frameCount);\n    quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);\n    pop();\n    \n  }\n}\n\nclass ShapeGrid {\n  constructor() {\n    this.shapes = [];\n    this.gridSize = shapesPerSide;\n    this.shapesize = (canvasWidth/this.gridSize) * 1.0;\n    this.spacing = this.shapesize * 1.0;\n    this.positionX = width / 2 - ((this.gridSize - 1) * this.spacing) / 2;\n    this.positionY = height / 2 - ((this.gridSize - 1) * this.spacing) / 2;\n\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.gridSize; i++) {\n      let row = [];\n      for (let j = 0; j &lt; this.gridSize; j++) {\n        row.push(\n          new Shape(\n            this.positionX + this.spacing * i,\n            this.positionY + this.spacing * j,\n            this.shapesize,\n            j,\n            i\n          )\n        );\n      }\n      this.shapes.push(row);\n    }\n  }\n\n  display() {\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.gridSize; i++) {\n      for (let j = 0; j &lt; this.gridSize; j++) {\n        this.shapes[i][j].display();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// set up background canvas\nfunction setup() {\n  let canvas = createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);\n  // move the canvas inside our &lt;div&gt;\n  canvas.parent('sketch');\n  angleMode(DEGREES);\n  grid = new ShapeGrid();\n}\n\n// draw shapes\nfunction draw() {\n  background(149, 151, 138);\n  grid.display();\n}"

Utilizing the extensive resources developed by the R user community, I was able to create a flexible, scalable reporting system that allows users to populate templated Google slide decks with metrics and professional-grade visualizations using data pulled directly from our database at the time of query. This streamlined approach enables our consultants to spend less time copy-pasting data from one channel to another and instead focus on what they do best: surfacing business-relevant insights and recommendations for our partners.\nBy sharing my approach to customizable self-serve reporting in Shiny, I hope attendees will walk away with new ideas about how to combine parameterized reporting and dashboard development to get the best of both worlds. Additionally, I hope to end by sharing how this project was pivotal in making the business case for procuring Posit products for my broader organization.\n\n Download Slides"

Like nearly every person on the planet, the past 2 (or 4… or 6…) years have left me incredibly burnt out. While I remain insatiably curious about the world around me, that curiosity has been sparking more anxiety than joy lately. As 2021 was winding down, I knew something needed to change. So I applied to the Recurse Center, was accepted, and here I am, beginning 2022 surrounded by a community of similarly curious programmers!\nIf you’re not familiar already, the Recurse Center is “a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers”. Retreats are run in “batches” that can be as short as one week (a “mini”) or as long as twelve weeks (a full batch). My batchmates come from all walks of life and are at all levels of coding experience, from decades-long careers at major software companies to career-changers just getting started. While most come from the software engineering or web development side of things, there are several other data scientists in the group. I am, however, the lone R programmer in my batch (or rather, the only one with that language as my main focus/love).\nGiven that one of my main goals for this experience is to shift from a scripting mindset to more of a development mindset, it has been wonderful to surround myself with folks that think deeply about what it takes to build simple, robust tools and programs. Though I do hope to inspire some others R/Shiny developers to consider doing a batch one day… I think our little community would be a very welcome addition to this one!"

(hi! hello! big fan! keep rocking!)\nRead a lot of the R Packages book and poked around the source code for several API R packages, including my badass friend, Sharla’s, dope opendatatoronto package (hi! hello! big fan! keep rocking!)\nWatched the first two lectures of Statistical Rethinking to (re-)learn Bayesian analysis. Richard McElreath is an incredible lecturer and got me excited about science again with his first lecture! (hi! hello! big fan! keep rocking!)\nWatched the Simple Made Easy lecture by Rich Hickey and joined the Software Complexity discussion group to listen in mostly… a lot of this went over my head but I enjoyed the breakdown of how to avoid “complecting” your programs.

I also want to continue learning JavaScript and playing in p5, despite how much I currently suck at it. I think a week of #genuary was enough for me, but I will be returning to those prompts to refactor and maybe build on the sketches I started and also tackle some of the #RecreationThursday prompts I missed.
