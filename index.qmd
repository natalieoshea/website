Hello there! I'm an anthropologist turned full-time R nerd ðŸ¤“

While working on my PhD in biological anthropology, I fell in love with reproducible research using R. Over the years, I grew less interested in pursuing an academic career so when an opportunity to transition into non-academic data science and analytics work presented itself at the beginning of 2020, I decided to jump ship. Since then I've been delighted to emerge myself fully in the broader R and data science community, including joining the leadership team for [Data Science by Design (DSxD)](http://datasciencebydesign.org/about), a community dedicated to developing a more open, ethical, and inclusive future for the field of data science.
